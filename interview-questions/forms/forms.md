# Forms

Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: reactive and template-driven.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Reactive</th>
            <th>Template-driven</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Setup (form model)</td>
            <td>More explicit, created in component class</td>
            <td>Less explicit, created by directives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data model</td>
            <td>Structured</td>
            <td>Unstructured</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Predictability</td>
            <td>Synchronous</td>
            <td>Asynchronous</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Form validation</td>
            <td>Functions</td>
            <td>Directives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mutability</td>
            <td>Immutable</td>
            <td>Mutable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Scalability</td>
            <td>Low-level API access</td>
            <td>Abstraction on top of APIs</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Common foundation

Both reactive and template-driven forms share underlying building blocks.

1. FormControl tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.

2. FormGroup tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.

3. FormArray tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.

4. ControlValueAccessor creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and native DOM elements.

## Control status CSS classes

Like in AngularJS, Angular automatically mirrors many control properties onto the form control element as CSS classes. You can use these classes to style form control elements according to the state of the form. The following classes are currently supported:

.ng-valid

.ng-invalid

.ng-pending // this class gets applied when async validator are used and they are not resolved yet

.ng-pristine

.ng-dirty

.ng-untouched

.ng-touched


<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>
                State
            </th>
            <th>
                Class if true
            </th>
            <th>
                Class if false
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                The control has been visited.
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-touched</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-untouched</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                The control's value has changed.
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-dirty</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-pristine</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                The control's value is valid.
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-valid</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>ng-invalid</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
