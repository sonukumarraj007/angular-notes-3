# Closure

Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.

MDN -
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
